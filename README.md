# Pascal-Interpretor (FUN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT)
This is a toy pascal interpretor which I am developing as a side project for fun when I have some spare time.

# FEATURES
The interpreter currently performs simple arithmatic computation:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Division
* Modulo

Arbitrary expressions are now supported using the supported Math Operators listed above. 

# UPCOMING FEATURE
In the next feature we will be focusing on associativity and precedence of operators.

#MORE WORK WILL BE ADDED WHEN I HAVE TIME.
